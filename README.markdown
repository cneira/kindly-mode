# Kindly Mode for Emacs

Kindly Mode provides Amazon Kindle-like view mode to Emacs.

Before using Kindly Mode, you must eval or add the following code into your .emacs:

    (require 'kindly-mode)

As Kindly Mode doesn't have specific relations to any file extensions, it won't be enabled until you enable it explicitly -- by M-x kindly-mode :).
